# Tweet-It
A Social media website with twitter like features. Have a look at [Tweet it](https://tweets-it.herokuapp.com "Tweet it's Homepage")

# Algorithms and Technologies Used
- node.js for backend servers.
- Jquery on frontend.
- Handlebars for templating.
- mongoDB for databases.
- AJAX requests for achieving realtime interaction.

# Loopholes
- Follower list is only updated when the page is reloaded.
- Currently the profile picture and cover picture is chosen randomly and there is no option to update it.

# Scope of Improvement
- A search feature can be implemented so as to look for the users using their username.
- Like and reply feature can be added to comments as well.
- DM can be implemented.
- UI can be improved further.
